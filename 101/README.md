Time taken to complete: roughly 1 hour and 15 minutes

Notes:

- My background in Web Development is mostly in JavaScript, but I had no trouble picking up PHP as it is more or less similar. My knowledge in problem solving and algorithms also helped me to understand and solve the problem.
- Since this is my first time using php, I had to reference the documentation numerous times as well as some StackOverflow posts to understand the syntax and how to use it.
